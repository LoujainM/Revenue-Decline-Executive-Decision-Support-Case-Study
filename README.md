# Revenue Decline – Executive Decision Support Case Study

## Business Context
A mid-sized company is experiencing a sustained revenue decline over the past two quarters. 
Senior management needs to understand potential causes and decide on corrective actions.

## Available Information
- Historical revenue by product and region
- Customer segmentation data
- Basic cost structure

## Key Questions
- Is the decline driven by volume, pricing, or customer concentration?
- Are specific regions or customer segments disproportionately impacted?
- What risks should management consider before taking action?

## Analysis Approach
This case study focuses on evaluating revenue performance patterns, identifying concentration risks, and assessing decision trade-offs rather than building predictive models.

## Key Findings
- Revenue is heavily concentrated among a small percentage of customers.
- Certain regions show sharper declines than others.
- Limited visibility into pricing elasticity introduces decision risk.

## Decision Options
1. Focus retention efforts on high-value customers.
2. Rebalance regional sales strategies.
3. Delay pricing changes until further data is available.

## Risks & Limitations
- Incomplete customer churn data
- No direct pricing elasticity measurements
- External market factors not fully captured

## Recommendation
Given the current information, management should prioritize customer retention and regional performance reviews before making pricing adjustments.

## Executive Summary
This analysis supports decision-making under uncertainty, highlighting trade-offs and risk considerations rather than optimizing for technical complexity.
