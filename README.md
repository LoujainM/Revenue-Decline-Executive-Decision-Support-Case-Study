# Revenue Decline – Executive Decision Support Case Study

## Business Context
A mid-sized company is facing a sustained revenue decline over the past two quarters. 
Executive management requires a clear, decision-oriented assessment to understand potential drivers and determine appropriate corrective actions under conditions of incomplete information.

## Available Information
The analysis is based on the following high-level inputs:
- Historical revenue trends by product and region
- Customer segmentation and revenue contribution
- High-level cost structure and operational assumptions

## Key Business Questions
- Is the revenue decline primarily driven by volume contraction, pricing pressure, or customer concentration?
- Are specific regions or customer segments disproportionately contributing to the decline?
- What decision risks should management consider before initiating corrective actions?

## Analysis Approach
This case study adopts an executive decision-support perspective.  
Rather than focusing on predictive modeling, the analysis emphasizes:
- Revenue performance patterns
- Customer concentration and exposure risk
- Trade-offs between speed of action and decision certainty

## Key Findings
- Revenue is highly concentrated among a small subset of customers, increasing exposure to churn-related risk.
- Certain regions exhibit materially sharper declines compared to the overall portfolio.
- Limited visibility into pricing elasticity constrains confidence in pricing-driven corrective actions.

## Decision Options Considered
1. Prioritize retention and engagement strategies for high-value customers to stabilize near-term revenue.
2. Rebalance regional sales and commercial focus toward underperforming areas.
3. Defer pricing adjustments until additional market and elasticity data becomes available.

## Risks & Limitations
- Customer churn data is incomplete, limiting precise attribution of revenue loss.
- Pricing elasticity has not been empirically measured.
- External market and competitive dynamics are not fully captured within the available data.

## Recommendation
Given the current information landscape, management should prioritize customer retention initiatives and targeted regional performance reviews before implementing pricing changes.  
This approach balances near-term revenue stabilization with risk mitigation while preserving optionality for future pricing decisions.

## Executive Summary
This case study demonstrates a structured approach to executive decision-making under uncertainty, emphasizing risk awareness, trade-offs, and strategic prioritization over technical complexity.
